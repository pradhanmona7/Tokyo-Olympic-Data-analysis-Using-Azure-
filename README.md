# Tokyo Olympic Data Analysis of Athletes Using Azure Cloud Infrastructure 

## Objective
I'm excited to share the successful completion of my Azure End-to-End Analytics Project on Azure cloud leveraging services like Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, Data Lake and Power BI. This project encompassed ingesting 2021 Tokyo Olympics dataset, building data transformation pipelines, developing a cloud data warehouse, and creating interactive BI dashboards.

## Summarizing the project:

* Utilized Azure Data Factory to ingest data from an HTTP source, ensuring seamless acquisition of the raw dataset.
* Stored the raw data securely in Azure Data Lake Gen2, leveraging its robust storage capabilities for data integrity and accessibility.
* Employed Apache Spark within Azure Databricks to transform the raw data, utilizing custom code to extract valuable insights and perform complex data transformations.
* Loaded the transformed data back into Azure Data Lake Gen2, now in a refined format ready for further analysis.
* Leveraged the advanced capabilities of Azure Synapse Analytics to seamlessly load and process the transformed dataset, facilitating powerful analytical workloads.
* Connected Azure Synapse Analytics to Power BI, enabling the creation of dynamic and visually engaging dashboards to present the insights gleaned from the data

This end-to-end implementation encompassed core data engineering concepts around scalable and secure cloud data platforms, data modeling, Spark and SQL programming. Learned to build reusable ETL components equipped for enterprise-grade solutions. Eager to apply this hands-on experience as an analytics engineering professional.
